    "## Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer these questions based on your work:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Why is it important to check for missing values before building a model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Machine learning algorithms are math equations. Most algorithms can't handle \"NaN\" values and will crash or throw errors. Even if they don't crash, missing data can lead to biased or inaccurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. When should you fill missing values vs. drop rows?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: When you have a lot of missing data in a column that is important, or when the number of rows with missing data is large you don't want to lose that much data. Drop when only a small percentage of rows are missing data like the 'embarked' part, or when a column is missing so much data it is useless like 'cabin'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Why did we use median instead of mean to fill missing ages?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The median is more robust to outliers. If there were a few 80byear olds on the ship, they would pull the Mean higher, potentially making it inaccurate for the average person. The Median represents the true \"middle\" of the crowd.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What could happen if we trained a model on data with missing values?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The code would likely fail/error out. If the library handles it automatically, it might make bad assumptions like assuming missing values are 0, leading to a model that makes bad predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Name one real-world scenario where missing data might occur.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A user skips an optional question on a survey; a weather sensor battery dies and stops recording temperature for an hour; a clerical error where a doctor forgets to write down a patient's weight. So could be a small deal, or a huge deal just depends."
